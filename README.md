# react-redux-router-boilerplate
This project is actually created for my personal use,
 not as a new annoying react boilerplate.
But if you like my project and want to use it, all is up to you. 

### Instructions
This boilerplate is used for small and non-large application,
 include Hot Module Replacement out of the box,
redux store, and routing for react app, plus Material-ui react components. Use beta version of @babel/core
for using new syntax <>code</> comes with react^16.2.0
 instead of additional *div* element,
and @babel-** plugin for successful building react.
*routes* folder contain all your routes in app,
*containers* is used for separate logic from presentation.

###Extended
If you want to use [preact-compat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact-compat), for smaller bundle size, all you need to do
is install [preact](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact) and [preact-compat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact-compat) 
packages to dependencies, then change configuration
in config/webpack.prod.config.js like this
```
resolve: {
    alias: {
    		    'react': 'preact-compat',
        'react-dom': 'preact-compat'
    }
}
```
